# Global On-Chain Invoicing Protocol
## A Decentralized Infrastructure for B2B Commerce

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

A protocol for issuing, verifying, and financing invoices entirely on-chain using Solana. Invoices become programmable NFTs with verifiable business identities (DIDs), enabling instant global liquidity, transparent pricing, and composable financial primitives. This is not just an invoice financing platform‚Äîit's the foundation for how all B2B transactions should work in a decentralized world.

**Vision:** Replace fragmented national invoicing systems (like Serbia's eFaktura) with a single, global, open-source protocol that any country, business, or protocol can adopt.

---

## üí° The Core Problem

### Current State of B2B Invoicing

**Fragmentation:**
- Every country has different invoicing systems
- Serbia: eFaktura (mandatory e-invoicing)
- EU: Multiple systems, standardization coming 2025-2028
- USA: No standard system
- Result: Cross-border invoicing is chaos

**Cash Flow Crisis:**
- Small businesses issue invoice on Day 1
- Client pays in 30-90 days (standard terms)
- Business needs cash NOW (payroll, suppliers, rent)
- Banks/factoring: Slow (1-2 weeks), expensive (5-10% fees), exclusive (50% rejection rate)

**Information Asymmetry:**
- Businesses: Can't prove creditworthiness easily
- Investors: Can't access invoice asset class
- Fraud: Double-financing, fake invoices
- No transparency in pricing or history

**Gatekeeping:**
- Need bank account (many businesses rejected)
- Need credit history (new businesses excluded)
- Need physical presence (international businesses blocked)
- Permission-based system (not meritocratic)

---

## üåç The Vision: Global Decentralized Invoicing

### What We're Building

**A protocol where:**
- Every invoice is an NFT on Solana
- Every business has a Decentralized Identifier (DID)
- Every payment is on-chain
- Credit history is portable globally
- Financing is permissionless and instant
- Trust is built through Verifiable Credentials

**End State (10 years):**
- Countries don't build national invoicing systems
- They adopt this protocol (like they adopted TCP/IP for internet)
- Every business has a Solana wallet
- Every B2B transaction flows through this infrastructure
- Traditional factoring/banking becomes obsolete

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Layer 1: Identity (Decentralized Identifiers)

**Every business has a DID:**
- Format: `did:solana:7xKj9...4fT2`
- Controlled by business (self-sovereign)
- Contains Verifiable Credentials from multiple issuers
- Portable across borders
- Privacy-preserving (selective disclosure possible)

**DID Document Structure:**
```
DID: did:solana:7xKj9...4fT2
Controller: Business wallet address
Verifiable Credentials:
  - BusinessRegistration (issued by: Government)
  - BankAccountVerification (issued by: Bank)
  - DomainOwnership (issued by: DNS Oracle)
  - ChamberMembership (issued by: Chamber of Commerce)
  - PaymentHistory (issued by: Protocol)
  - PeerEndorsements (issued by: Other Businesses)
Trust Score: Calculated from credentials (0-100)
Created: Timestamp
Updated: Timestamp
```

**Key Innovation:**
Instead of ONE gatekeeper (bank) deciding if business is legitimate, we have MULTIPLE independent attesters. Decentralized trust.

---

### Layer 2: Verifiable Credentials

**Multiple types of credentials:**

**1. Government-Issued:**
- Business Registration (company exists in official registry)
- Tax Compliance (current on taxes)
- License Verification (for regulated industries)
- Issuer: Government agencies (Serbia APR, US Secretary of State, etc.)
- Trust weight: 40 points

**2. Financial Institution-Issued:**
- Bank Account Verification (business has legitimate bank account)
- Credit History (payment behavior)
- Financial Health (revenue, solvency)
- Issuer: Banks, credit bureaus
- Trust weight: 20 points

**3. Automated Oracle-Issued:**
- Domain Ownership (business controls website)
- Social Media Verification (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Physical Address Verification (via postal code)
- Issuer: Automated oracles (DNS, APIs)
- Trust weight: 10 points

**4. Professional Organization-Issued:**
- Chamber of Commerce membership
- Industry certifications
- Professional licenses
- Issuer: Chambers, trade associations
- Trust weight: 15 points

**5. Peer-Issued (Web of Trust):**
- Endorsements from clients
- References from partners
- Supplier testimonials
- Issuer: Other verified businesses
- Trust weight: 2 points each (up to 10 total)

**6. Protocol-Issued (On-Chain Reputation):**
- Payment history (% of invoices paid on time)
- Volume history (total transaction volume)
- Longevity (account age)
- Issuer: Smart contract (automatic)
- Trust weight: Up to 15 points

**Trust Score Calculation:**
Sum of all credential weights, capped at 100. Different protocols can weigh credentials differently based on their risk tolerance.

---

### Layer 3: Invoice NFTs

**Every invoice is an NFT with metadata:**
```
Invoice NFT Metadata:
  ID: Unique identifier
  Issuer DID: did:solana:business-a
  Recipient DID: did:solana:business-b
  Amount: 10,000 USDC
  Currency: USDC (or other SPL token)
  Issue Date: Timestamp
  Due Date: Timestamp
  Payment Terms: Net 60
  Description: "Web development services - Project X"
  Line Items: Detailed breakdown (stored on IPFS/Arweave)
  Status: Unpaid | Financed | Paid | Disputed | Defaulted
  Issuer Trust Score: 87/100 (at time of creation)
  Recipient Trust Score: 92/100
  Payment History: (updated when paid)
  Financing Terms: (if financed)
  Metadata URI: Link to full invoice data (IPFS)
```

**Invoice Lifecycle:**

1. **Creation:**
    - Business A issues invoice to Business B
    - NFT minted on Solana
    - Sent to Business B's wallet
    - Business B sees: "You have 1 unpaid invoice"

2. **Optional Financing:**
    - Business A needs cash now
    - Lists invoice on financing marketplace
    - Global investors can bid
    - Best offer wins (transparent pricing)

3. **Payment:**
    - Business B pays invoice (sends USDC to smart contract)
    - If financed: Smart contract distributes to investor
    - If not financed: Goes directly to Business A
    - NFT burned or marked "Paid"

4. **Reputation Update:**
    - Payment credential issued automatically
    - Added to both parties' DID documents
    - "Business A issued invoice, got paid on time"
    - "Business B received invoice, paid on time"
    - Trust scores updated

---

### Layer 4: Financing Marketplace

**Global, permissionless liquidity pool:**

**How It Works:**

**For Businesses (Borrowers):**
1. Issue invoice ‚Üí mint NFT
2. Request financing ‚Üí list on marketplace
3. Receive bids from global investors
4. Accept best offer ‚Üí instant USDC in wallet
5. When invoice is paid ‚Üí investor gets repaid automatically

**For Investors (Lenders):**
1. Browse available invoices
2. See: Amount, issuer trust score, recipient trust score, terms, history
3. Bid on invoices (competitive marketplace)
4. Capital locked in smart contract escrow
5. Automatic repayment when invoice paid

**Marketplace Transparency:**
```
Invoice #7xKj9...4fT2
Issuer: Construction Co (DID: did:solana:...)
  - Trust Score: 87/100
  - Credentials: Government ‚úì, Bank ‚úì, Domain ‚úì, 200 invoices paid
  - Payment History: 97% on-time rate
  - Industry: Construction
  
Recipient: Tech Corp (DID: did:solana:...)
  - Trust Score: 92/100
  - Payment History: 99% on-time rate
  
Invoice Details:
  - Amount: 10,000 USDC
  - Due: 60 days
  - Description: "Renovation work"
  
Current Bids:
  - Investor A: 8,500 USDC advance (15% fee) ‚Üê Best offer
  - Investor B: 8,300 USDC advance (17% fee)
  - Investor C: 8,700 USDC advance (13% fee - requires higher trust)
  
Historical Context:
  - Similar invoices: Average 14.2% return
  - Default rate for this trust level: 2.1%
  - Average payment delay: 3 days early
```

**Pricing Discovery:**
Market determines pricing based on:
- Issuer trust score (higher = lower rate)
- Recipient trust score (higher = lower rate)
- Invoice amount (smaller = higher rate)
- Payment terms (longer = higher rate)
- Industry (some riskier than others)
- Historical performance (track record matters)
- Current market conditions (supply/demand)

**Result:** Transparent, competitive, fair pricing. No black-box bank decisions.

---

### Layer 5: Smart Contract Escrow

**Trustless settlement:**

**Invoice Financing Flow:**
1. Investor deposits USDC to smart contract
2. Smart contract verifies invoice exists and is valid
3. Smart contract sends advance to business (e.g., 85% of invoice value)
4. Remaining funds stay in escrow
5. Invoice NFT locked as collateral
6. When due date arrives:
    - If paid: Distribute funds to investor (principal + return)
    - If not paid after grace period: Mark as defaulted, handle collection
7. Invoice NFT burned or released

**Key Properties:**
- No trust in platform operator required
- Funds are provably locked
- Settlement is automatic (no human intervention)
- All rules encoded in smart contract
- Transparent (anyone can verify)

---

## üîë Solving the Identity Problem

### Why DID is the Perfect Solution

**The Challenge:**
How do we know `did:solana:7xKj9...4fT2` actually belongs to "Construction Co d.o.o." and not an impersonator?

**Traditional Approach:**
Single authority (bank, government) verifies ‚Üí centralized, gatekept

**Our Approach:**
Multiple independent attesters verify ‚Üí decentralized, inclusive

### Credential Issuance Process

**Government Verification:**
1. Business applies through government portal
2. Government verifies against official registry (APR, Companies House, etc.)
3. Government issues credential signed with their DID
4. Credential added to business's DID document
5. Anyone can verify: "Is this credential validly signed by government?"

**Bank Verification:**
1. Business has bank account
2. Bank verifies business controls account
3. Bank issues credential (doesn't reveal account number)
4. Proves: "This business has legitimate banking relationship"

**Domain Verification (Automated):**
1. Business adds TXT record to DNS: `_did.company.com = "did:solana:7xKj9...4fT2"`
2. Oracle checks DNS record
3. If match: Oracle issues domain ownership credential
4. Proves: "This business controls this domain"

**Chamber Verification:**
1. Business is member of Chamber of Commerce
2. Chamber issues membership credential
3. Proves: "This business is in good standing with professional organization"

**Peer Verification (Web of Trust):**
1. Business A works with Business B
2. Business B endorses Business A on-chain
3. Credential issued from B's DID to A's DID
4. Multiple endorsements build social proof

**Reputation Verification (Automatic):**
1. Business issues invoices over time
2. Clients pay (or don't pay)
3. Protocol automatically issues payment history credential
4. Transparent, verifiable track record

### Progressive Trust Model

**Verification Levels:**

**Level 0: Unverified (0-9 points)**
- Just created wallet
- No credentials
- Limits: Cannot issue invoices
- Action needed: Get at least one credential

**Level 1: Basic (10-29 points)**
- Domain verified OR social media verified
- Limits: $1,000 max invoice, no financing
- Purpose: Small freelancers, testing

**Level 2: Verified (30-49 points)**
- Domain + social verified OR bank verified
- Limits: $10,000 max invoice, $5,000 max financing
- Purpose: Small businesses, contractors

**Level 3: Highly Verified (50-69 points)**
- Bank verified + domain verified + some history
- Limits: $100,000 max invoice, $50,000 max financing
- Purpose: Established small businesses

**Level 4: Fully Verified (70-100 points)**
- Government verified + bank verified + strong history + endorsements
- Limits: Unlimited
- Purpose: Enterprise businesses

**Key Properties:**
- Permissionless entry (anyone can start)
- Progressive trust (build over time)
- Multiple paths to verification (no single gatekeeper)
- Transparent criteria (rules are public)
- Dynamic (trust adjusts with behavior)

## üåê Global Scalability

### How This Works Across Countries

**The Problem:**
Every country has different business registration systems, different laws, different verification processes.

**The Solution:**
Protocol is universal. Credential issuers are local.

**Example: Same Protocol, Different Issuers**

**Serbia:**
- Government credential issuer: APR (Agencija za privredne registre)
- Bank credential issuers: UniCredit Serbia, Raiffeisen Serbia, etc.
- Chamber: Privredna komora Srbije
- DID: `did:solana:gov-rs-apr`

**USA:**
- Government credential issuers: Secretary of State (per state)
- Bank credential issuers: Chase, BofA, Wells Fargo, etc.
- Chamber: Local chambers of commerce
- DID: `did:solana:gov-us-delaware`

**Nigeria:**
- Government credential issuer: CAC (Corporate Affairs Commission)
- Bank credential issuers: Access Bank, Zenith Bank, etc.
- Chamber: NACCIMA
- DID: `did:solana:gov-ng-cac`

**The Magic:**
- Business in Serbia can do business with client in USA
- Both have DIDs with credentials from their local issuers
- Protocol understands both (trust calculation is universal)
- Financing comes from global pool (not limited to local capital)
- Payment is instant (USDC on Solana, no SWIFT delays)

**Cross-Border Invoice Example:**
```
Serbian Construction Co (DID: did:solana:7xKj9...)
  Credentials:
    - BusinessRegistration (issuer: gov-rs-apr)
    - BankAccount (issuer: unicredit-serbia)
  
Issues invoice to:

German Tech Co (DID: did:solana:8yLm2...)
  Credentials:
    - BusinessRegistration (issuer: gov-de-handelsregister)
    - BankAccount (issuer: deutsche-bank)

Invoice: 10,000 EUR (in USDC)
Financed by: Japanese investor
Payment: Instant on Solana
No banks involved. No SWIFT. No 3-5 day delays.
```

## üíé Key Innovations

### 1. Programmable Invoices

Invoices become smart contracts that can execute logic:

**Auto-Reminders:**
- 7 days before due date: Reminder sent to client automatically
- On due date: Another reminder
- 3 days after due date: Late notice

**Auto-Discounts:**
- If client pays 10+ days early: 2% discount applied automatically
- If client pays at exactly due date: No discount
- Smart contract handles math, refunds difference

**Auto-Late Fees:**
- 1 day late: 0.5% penalty added
- 7 days late: 2% penalty
- 30 days late: 5% penalty + potential default
- Accumulates automatically

**Recurring Invoices:**
- Invoice paid successfully
- Smart contract automatically creates next month's invoice
- Series of invoices for ongoing services

**Conditional Payments:**
- "Pay 50% upfront, 50% on completion"
- Smart contract holds second payment
- Released when work verified (oracle or client confirmation)

**Milestone-Based:**
- Construction project with 5 milestones
- Separate invoice for each milestone
- Can't create next invoice until previous paid
- Ensures payment discipline

---

### 2. Portable Credit History

**Current Problem:**
- Build credit in one country
- Move to another country
- Start from zero (history doesn't transfer)

**Solution:**
Credit history lives in DID (which is global)

**Example:**
```
Business wallet: did:solana:7xKj9...4fT2

Payment History Credential:
  - Total invoices issued: 347
  - Total invoices paid: 342
  - Payment rate: 98.6%
  - Average payment delay: -2 days (pays early!)
  - Total volume: $2.3M
  - Largest invoice: $45,000
  - Smallest invoice: $200
  - Active since: January 2024
  - Industries served: Construction, Real Estate
  - Geographic regions: Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia

This history follows the wallet everywhere.
German investor can see: "This Serbian business has excellent track record"
US bank can see: "This is a reliable borrower"
```

**Implications:**
- Immigrants/expats keep their business credit
- International businesses don't need separate credit in each country
- Emerging market businesses can access developed market capital
- Merit-based (history speaks for itself)

---

### 3. Instant Credit Scoring

**Traditional:**
- Submit application
- Human analyst reviews (2-5 days)
- Credit committee meets (another 2 days)
- Decision: 1 week total

**On-Chain:**
```
Query: Get credit score for did:solana:7xKj9...4fT2

Smart contract:
1. Load DID document
2. Count credentials (government, bank, domain, etc.)
3. Check payment history (% on-time, volume, age)
4. Check endorsements (peer verification)
5. Calculate score: 0-100

Response: 87/100 (in <1 second)

Breakdown:
  - Government verified: +40
  - Bank verified: +20
  - Domain verified: +10
  - 342 paid invoices: +15
  - 5 peer endorsements: +2
  Total: 87
```

**Anyone can query this. It's transparent. It's instant.**

---

### 4. Composability with DeFi

**Invoices become DeFi primitives:**

**Use Case A: Collateral for Lending**
```
Business has unpaid invoice: 10,000 USDC, due in 30 days
Deposit invoice NFT into Aave
Borrow against it: 4,000 USDC (40% LTV)
When invoice is paid:
  - Aave loan auto-repaid
  - Business keeps difference (6,000 USDC)
```

**Use Case B: Invoice-Backed Stablecoin**
```
Protocol holds 1,000 verified invoices
Total value: 10,000,000 USDC
Issue stablecoin backed by invoices: 8,000,000 INVO
Stablecoin redeemable for underlying invoices
Similar to how USDC is backed by treasuries
```

**Use Case C: Invoice Index Fund**
```
Fund holds 500 diverse invoices
Investors buy fund tokens
Exposure to invoice asset class
Diversified across industries, geographies, risk levels
Liquid (can trade fund tokens)
```

**Use Case D: Automated Insurance**
```
Insurance protocol on Solana
Business pays 1% premium
If invoice defaults: Insurance pays out
Insurance pool funded by premiums
Risk priced based on trust scores
All automatic, no paperwork
```

**Use Case E: Yield Farming**
```
Provide liquidity to invoice financing pool
Earn yield from financing fees
Plus governance tokens
Stake those tokens for more yield
Full DeFi experience with real-world assets
```

**The Power:** Once invoices are on-chain, they can interact with ALL other DeFi protocols. Permissionless composability.

---

### 5. Secondary Market for Invoices

**Traditional:**
- Investor funds invoice
- Locked in for 60 days
- Can't exit early

**With Secondary Market:**
```
Day 0: Investor A funds 10,000 USDC invoice (60 days, 15% return)
Day 30: Investor A needs liquidity
        Lists invoice token on secondary market
        Asks: 9,900 USDC (still profit, but exits early)
        
        Investor B sees: "30 days left, 10% return if paid"
        Investor B buys invoice token for 9,900 USDC
        
Day 60: Invoice paid, 10,000 USDC goes to Investor B

Result:
  - Investor A: Made 9,900 - 8,500 = 1,400 USDC (16.5% return in 30 days)
  - Investor B: Made 10,000 - 9,900 = 100 USDC (1% return in 30 days)
  - Business: Got funding, paid as normal
  - Everyone wins
```

**Benefits:**
- Liquidity for investors (can exit early)
- Price discovery (market determines fair value)
- Different risk appetites (some want short-term, some long-term)
- More capital attracted (because of liquidity)

---

### 6. Transparent Pricing

**Traditional Factoring:**
```
Business: "How much will this cost?"
Factor: "5% fee"
Business: "Why 5%?"
Factor: "That's our rate"
Business: "Can I negotiate?"
Factor: "No"
```

**On-Chain Marketplace:**
